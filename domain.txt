Dear Adel Sbeh (EnderCommunity), Thank you for purchasing one of our premium hosting paid plans.

Below are your account details, you will need your username and password to access ftp and your control panel.

New Account Info

Domain: mur-lang.org Username: murlango Password: Q51-cBbuI3:3Mz Hosting Package: Starter Premium Hosting Server IP: 185.27.133.14 Nameserver 1: ns1081.ifastnet.com Nameserver 2: ns2081.ifastnet.com FTP Hostname: sv81.ifastnet.com Webpage URL: http://www.mur-lang.org

Control Panel: https://sv81.ifastnet.com:2083

You may use the below temporary information to access your website if your domain is not currently resolving / propagating.

Temporary FTP Hostname: 185.27.133.14

The Control panel requires the TCP ports 2083 and 2082 to be open on your local firewall / router, if you are trying to access the control panel from a location that does NOT allow these ports you can use the installed cPanel Proxy at http://cpanel.sv81.ifastnet.com however some cpanel services will not work correctly via the proxy, we therefore recommend you get these ports opened as soon as possible. Please keep in mind that your domain name will not be visible on the internet for between 24 and 72 hours. This process is called Propagation. Until your domain has Propagated your website and email will not function.

IMPORTANT: Make sure you upload your files to the PUBLIC_HTML or www directory on the server otherwise they will not be visible on the internet. Also, please be sure that your homepage is saved as an index file e.g., index.htm, index.html, index.php etc. We suggest you download filezilla from http://filezilla-project.org/ if you do not already have an ftp client.

CLOUDFLARE!

We would recommend using the 'CloudFlare' option in your control panel to make your website much faster and more secure from web application attacks, setup takes a few clicks and offers excellent protection / speed and functionality. For more information on setting up CloudFlare please see :KnowledgeBase
